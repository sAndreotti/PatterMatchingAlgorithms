# Naive
Naive approach to pattern matching problem, aka Brute-Force

## How it works
Scanning the text with a window equals to the pattern and going on one position at the time it find all the occurencies of the pattern in the text

## Requirements
This program use only the basic function of python and the built-in library os

## Parameters
Pattern and Text can be setted using the pattern.txt and text.txt file

```
naive.py
```

## Time
In the best case the time is O(n), in the worst O(n^2), where n is the text's length
