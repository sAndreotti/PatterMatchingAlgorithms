# Patter Matching Algorithms
Implementation of various pattern matching algorithms with example and some introduction

## Algortithms 

Each algorithm have is own folder with little documentation, 2 text file for pattern and text and the implementation

- Aho-Corasick
- Boyer-Moore
- Karp-Rabin
- Knuth-Morris-Pratt (KMP)
- Naive
- Z-algorithm

## Why this project

This project is meant to be a practical approch to some algorithm for pattern matching that i've encountered during my master degree in Univeristy of Milano-Bicocca, these are simple implementation but doing these the algorithm will persist after the courses
